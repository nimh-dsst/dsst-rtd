# COI_AP
The COI (Child Opportunity Index) and AP (Affective Posner task) dataset was prepared for the Section on Mood Dysregulation and Neuroscience (SMDN), which is part of the [Emotional and Development Branch (EDB)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb) within the NIMH. SMDN is led by [Dr. Ellen Leibenluft](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/principal-investigators/ellen-leibenluft).

## Summary
The goal for this dataset was to publish it to OpenNeuro.  
The dataset included the following types of data:

1. Imaging

   - Anatomical scans (T1w)

   - Task-based functional MRI

2. Task Data

   - Affective Posner (AP) task: some runs acquired with/without fMRI data

3. Phenotype data
