# Phenotyping and DTI
The Phenotyping and DTI dataset was prepared for the Section on Mood Dysregulation and Neuroscience (SMDN), which is part of the [Emotional and Development Branch (EDB)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb) within the NIMH. SMDN is led by [Dr. Ellen Leibenluft](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/principal-investigators/ellen-leibenluft).

## Summary
The goal for this dataset was to publish it to OpenNeuro in time for an associated manuscript submission.  
The dataset included the following types of data:

1. Imaging

   - Anatomical scans (T1w, T2w)

   - Diffusion weighted scans 

3. Phenotype

We actively collaborated with the first author on the manuscript, Dr. Cameron McKay, a postdoc on the SMDN group to 

* Deface structural scans and visual QC them

* Draft modality agnostic files

* Rename files based on unique acquisition groups

* Upload to OpenNeuro
