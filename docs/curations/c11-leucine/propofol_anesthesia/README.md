# Effects of propofol anesthesia on rates of cerebral protein synthesis

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 2,3-diisopropylphenol (propofol) anesthesia on rates of Cerebral Protein Synthesis (rCPS). We studied 10 healthy young male volunteers who each underwent two L-[1-11C]leucine PET studies: awake and anesthetized with propofol. Our measurements showed no significant effects of propofol anesthesia on values of rCPS in all examined regions (Reference 1).

## Measurement of rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) in human subjects

The L-[1-11C]leucine PET method for measurement of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) in human subjects is based on the in-vivo autoradiographic method for measurement of rCPS in animals (Reference 2). The method utilizes dynamic PET scanning with concurrent arterial blood sampling. A kinetic modeling approach is used to account for the dilution of the specific activity of the tissue precursor amino acid pool for protein synthesis with amino acids, largely unlabeled, that come from the steady state breakdown of protein in the tissue; these amino acids are a significant source of leucine in brain. The method was validated in rhesus monkeys (Reference 3). In the first human studies the method was demonstrated to produce low variance and highly reproducible measures of rCPS (Reference 4). Early studies utilized region of interest kinetic model analyses; a voxel-based approach was subsequently developed (References 5 and 6, see Reference 6's supplement for modification of voxel-based algorithm). In addition to reducing the effects of tissue kinetic heterogeneity on calculations of rCPS, the voxel-based approach allows the construction of parametric rCPS images.

The scanning procedure used in the originally developed method proved too difficult for subjects with intellectual disabilities to tolerate without sedation. To make it easier for these participants to tolerate the procedure while awake, modified methods were developed and validated to shorten the scanning interval (Reference 7) and substitute venous for arterial blood sampling (Reference 8).

Included in the current dataset are L-[1-11C]leucine 4D PET emission images, co-registered MR images, blood sampling data, and parametric rCPS images.
