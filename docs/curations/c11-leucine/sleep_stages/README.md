# Rates of cerebral protein synthesis in stages of sleep

During sleep, reduced brain energy demands provide an opportunity for biosynthetic processes like protein synthesis.  Sleep is required for some forms of memory consolidation, and memory consolidation requires de novo protein synthesis. We measured regional cerebral protein synthesis rates (rCPS) in human subjects to ascertain how brain protein synthesis is affected during sleep. Subjects underwent three consecutive L-[1-11C]leucine PET scans with simultaneous polysomnography:

1. Rested awake
2. Sleep-deprived awake
3. Sleep

Measured rCPS were similar across the three conditions. Variations in sleep stage times during sleep scans were used to estimate rCPS in sleep stages under the assumption that measured rCPS is the weighted sum of rCPS in each sleep stage, with weights reflecting time and availability of C-11 leucine in sleep stage. Across regions, estimated rCPS in combined stages N1 and N2 were 7-28% higher and estimated rCPS in N3 were similar to rCPS measured in sleep-deprived awake scans. Results demonstrate increased rates of protein synthesis linked to sleep (Reference 1).

## Measurement of rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) in human subjects

The L-[1-11C]leucine PET method for measurement of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) in human subjects is based on the in-vivo autoradiographic method for measurement of rCPS in animals (Reference 2). The method utilizes dynamic PET scanning with concurrent arterial blood sampling. A kinetic modeling approach is used to account for the dilution of the specific activity of the tissue precursor amino acid pool for protein synthesis with amino acids, largely unlabeled, that come from the steady state breakdown of protein in the tissue; these amino acids are a significant source of leucine in brain. The method was validated in rhesus monkeys (Reference 3). In the first human studies the method was demonstrated to produce low variance and highly reproducible measures of rCPS (Reference 4). Early studies utilized region of interest kinetic model analyses; a voxel-based approach was subsequently developed (References 5 and 6, see Reference 6's supplement for modification of voxel-based algorithm). In addition to reducing the effects of tissue kinetic heterogeneity on calculations of rCPS, the voxel-based approach allows the construction of parametric rCPS images.

The scanning procedure used in the originally developed method proved too difficult for subjects with intellectual disabilities to tolerate without sedation. To make it easier for these participants to tolerate the procedure while awake, modified methods were developed and validated to shorten the scanning interval (Reference 7) and substitute venous for arterial blood sampling (Reference 8).

Included in the current dataset are L-[1-11C]leucine 4D PET emission images, co-registered MR images, blood sampling data, and parametric rCPS images.
