# ABCD DSST data sets

Welcome to the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD) data sets, curated by the Data Science and Sharing Team (DSST) at NIMH!

This README gives a high-level overview of the contents of the dataset. For more detailed information, please see the README and CHANGES files within each subdirectory.

This dataset currently contains the following data.

## collection_3165

- [README](https://github.com/nimh-dsst/dsst-rtd/tree/main/docs/guides/ABCD/collection_3165/README)

An NDA collection of input (unprocessed) and derivative (processed) imaging data from the DCAN Labs' ABCD BIDS Community Collection (ABCC).  Derivatives were processed through the DCAN Labs' ABCD BIDS pipeline ([abcd-hcp-pipeline](https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/abcd-hcp-pipeline)).

## fast_track

- [README.md](https://github.com/nimh-dsst/dsst-rtd/tree/main/docs/guides/ABCD/fast_track/README.md)
- [CHANGES](https://github.com/nimh-dsst/dsst-rtd/tree/main/docs/guides/ABCD/fast_track/CHANGES.md)

The NDA releases newly-collected raw DICOM data every so often. We do our best to stay up to date with downloading the DICOM data and converting it to a BIDS tree of NIfTI images. See the CHANGES file above for a change-log of when the last update occured and what was included in each update.

## tabulated_data

Every year the NDA releases it's "Curated Annual Release" of tabulated data. Here is where you'll find all of the phenotypic, behavioral, demographic, and other curated annual release data. See the [ABCD tabulated data dictionary](https://data-dict.abcdstudy.org/?), the [ABCD Wiki](https://wiki.abcdstudy.org/), or the [NDA ABCD page](https://nda.nih.gov/abcd) for more information about the data contained therein. Note: the raw tabulated data are not distributed in a BIDS-compliant format.
