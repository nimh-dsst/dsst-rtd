# Welcome

This ReadTheDocs site is maintained by the the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Data Science & Sharing Team (DSST) to give the Intramural Research Program (IRP) DSST-curated dataset users access to readily available dataset documentation.  Nothing private is stored here.  The documents here are kept as up-to-date as possible, rendered from [the dsst-rtd GitHub repository](https://github.com/nih-fmrif/dsst-rtd).
